          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>Obesity does not appear to have a correlation to median household income or a state's percentage of residents
            below the poverty line.  It does appear to have some correlation to median ages from 34-42 years old for majority
            of states in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Smoking also does not appear to be correlated to individual states' percent of residents living below the poverty
            level.  It is, however, proportional to percent of residents living in poverty for most states.  It does seem to have 
            a correlation to median household income.  Generally, for mean household incomes less than 55,000, the percentage of
            smokers per state start to increase.  Smoking also does not appear to correlated to any particular age.  Considering
            that the legal age for smoking in the U.S. is 18 and, according to the CDC, the average life span for smokers is 
            approximately 10 years shorter than for non-smokers, it seems reasonable that percent of smokers is clustered between 
            36 and 42.  Additionally worth noting is that smoking cessation prior to 40 years of age reduces the risk of dying 
            from smoking related diseases.</p>

          <p>Percentage of uninsured residents also appears to be weakly related to percentage of residents living below the poverty line.
            As the percentage of residents living in poverty rises for a given state, the rate of those uninsured also gradually rises.  
            There seems to be a stronger correlation between state and percentage of insured residents with more southern states having
            higher rates of uninsured residents.  As with obesity and smoking, the age median distribution for percent of uninsured 
            residents is between 36 and 42.  While not strong, or immediately obvious, rate of uninsured resident gradually decreases 
            as median household income rises.
